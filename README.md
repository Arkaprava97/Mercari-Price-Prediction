# Mercari Price Prediction :

Product pricing gets is a tricky task which gets harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Mercari, Japan's biggest community-powered shopping app, would like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough especially because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace. 
In this project, we've built a model that can predict the resale price of products - it is a regression problem.
